---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Click the menu above:** `📄 Doc Extractor` → `🔗 Extract Docs...`

3. **Click Extract** → A ZIP file is created in your Google Drive
4. **Download** the ZIP from Drive

## 📦 What You'll Get

For each Google Doc, you'll receive:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TabName_annotated.txt` | All text content, with tables preserved |
| `TabName_IMG_1.png` | Each image extracted separately |
| `TabName_IMG_2.png` | (numbered in order they appear) |

If a doc has multiple tabs, each tab gets its own set of files.

## 📍 Where To Find Your Files

After extraction:
1. A dialog will appear with **"Open in Drive"** button
2. Click it to see your ZIP file in Google Drive
3. Click the **⬇️ download icon** in Drive to save to your computer

The ZIP will be in your **Drive root folder** (My Drive).
