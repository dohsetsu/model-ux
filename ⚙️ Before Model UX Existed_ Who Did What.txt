⚙️ Before Model UX Existed: Who Did What? Layer / Responsibility Who Owned It Before Resulting Gap or Pain Point User experience & intent UX Research + Content Design Intent captured, but not translated into model behavior — UX stopped at surface language Prompt / instruction design Engineers (ad hoc) or PMs Prompting handled inconsistently — lacked linguistic or contextual nuance Model reasoning behavior (CoT, schema, style) No one clearly owned it “The missing layer” — system behavior evolved accidentally, not intentionally Evaluation of model outputs Research / QA / Eng Focused on accuracy, not experience or brand expression Response shaping (tone, persona, narrative) Content Design Adjusted after the fact — couldn’t influence underlying reasoning System documentation & reproducibility Engineering Captured code-level detail, not design-level intent or method Bridging between human experience and model interpretation No clear owner Designers couldn’t see model internals; Engineers couldn’t see user perception — no connective tissue


🧩 The missing layer → Model UX: That “no clear owner” middle space — between UX intent and model reasoning — is where Model UX now lives. It ensures the model’s reasoning, behavior, and responses are designed experiences, not just byproducts of system tuning.


Would you like me to extend this into an “after Model UX” version right beneath it (so it’s a before/after evolution chart)? It makes the “bridge” concept pop immediately for leadership decks. You said: Yes, but I also want a summarization of table of why this was suboptimal- what fails were happening? What was getting overlooked/missed? What was being done (perhaps poorly) by (perhaps the wrong) people? ChatGPT said: Excellent — this is the right instinct 👏 Here’s the expanded version that includes the “why this was suboptimal” layer — the why Model UX had to exist story. You can think of this as a forensics table: “what was happening before,” “who handled it,” and “what broke or got missed.”


🧩 Before Model UX Existed — What Was Happening and Why It Failed Responsibility Layer Who Owned It (Before Model UX) Symptoms / What Went Wrong Why It Was Suboptimal Understanding user intent UX Research & Content Design Intent documented in Figma or copydocs, but stopped at the interface Intent was never expressed as model behavior — translation gap between “what user means” and “what model does” Prompt / instruction design Engineers or PMs (ad hoc) Prompts written for system efficiency, not linguistic nuance No design discipline for “instruction writing”; outputs felt robotic, inconsistent, or brittle Reasoning scaffolds (CoT, CoE, schema) Nobody clearly Model behavior emerged accidentally from examples or fine-tuning Reasoning style inconsistent, leaky, noisy — no control over how the model thinks Response shaping (tone, persona, phrasing) Content Design Polished surface-level copy after generation Tone fixed after reasoning — couldn’t address logic or structure errors underneath Output evaluation / QA Eng & Research Focused on correctness or latency No lens for user experience of model output — no framework for “feel,” clarity, or voice alignment Behavior reproducibility / documentation Eng Captured code, not intent When things broke, teams couldn’t trace why a model behaved that way — no behavioral audit trail Cross-functional handoff between UX and Eng PM as translator Misinterpretations on both sides UX couldn’t affect the model’s inner workings; Eng couldn’t interpret human-centered requirements


💥 Summary: The Systemic Fails Failure Type Description Impact Ownership gaps No one owned the space between user intent and model reasoning Models behaved unpredictably and inconsistently Discipline mismatch Linguistic, ethical, or tonal judgment left to engineers; system-level design left to writers Everyone was half-doing someone else’s job badly Lack of observability No visibility into reasoning traces or data influence Teams couldn’t debug or iterate responsibly Shallow feedback loops Evaluation based on correctness, not experience We optimized for precision, not trust or usability Post-hoc polish mindset Writers “fixed” outputs instead of designing better behaviors Effort multiplied, results decayed over time Cultural blind spot “Language = copy” assumption Organizations undervalued the behavioral design dimension entirely


🧠 In short: Before Model UX, everyone was touching the model, but no one was designing it. Content Design focused on voice, Eng focused on performance — and the experience of the model itself fell through the cracks.


Would you like me to now build the “after Model UX” continuation, showing how each of these same layers look once the discipline fills the gap? That’ll make it a perfect before/after slide pair for leadership. You said: Yes please! Phew! Thank goodness for your memory!! ChatGPT said: Ha — I remember this one vividly 😄 because it’s one of those foundational “aha” tables that helped define why your role needed to exist. Here’s the After Model UX version, directly continuing from that last table — and a short synthesis section summarizing why this fixed what was broken.


🚀 After Model UX — Filling the Missing Layer Responsibility Layer Who Owns It Now What’s Different / Improved Why It Works Better Understanding user intent Model UX + UX Research Intent expressed as behavioral scaffolds (prompts, constraints, evaluation schemas) Converts human goals → machine-understandable structure Prompt / instruction design Model UX + Eng Prompts designed as interfaces, not hacks Consistent reasoning behavior; reusable patterns Reasoning scaffolds (CoT, CoE, schema) Model UX Intentional reasoning style; transparent thinking layers Makes reasoning inspectable, editable, teachable Response shaping (tone, persona, phrasing) Model UX + Content Design Voice and tone applied at reasoning level, not just surface The system “sounds right” because it thinks right Output evaluation / QA Model UX + UXR + Eng Adds UX-quality metrics (clarity, trust, consistency) Evaluations now measure experience, not just correctness Behavior reproducibility / documentation Model UX + Eng Design-level reasoning captured alongside code Enables behavioral debugging and repeatable improvements Cross-functional handoff between UX and Eng Model UX as bridge Shared language and shared artifacts Eliminates translation loss; both sides iterate on the same behavior


💡 Why This Works (Summary) Problem Before How Model UX Fixes It Intent lost in translation Encodes user intent directly into prompts, reasoning templates, and evaluations Inconsistent behavior Introduces design governance for reasoning and response layers “Copy polish” seen as surface work Expands content design into system-level communication design Engineering owned too much language responsibility Returns linguistic and narrative control to design, where it belongs Teams couldn’t see or debug reasoning Makes reasoning visible and tunable as a design surface Evaluation focused on accuracy only Adds trust, clarity, and tone fidelity to the metrics stack PMs as translators between silos Model UX creates a common behavioral framework both sides understand


🧩 In essence: Before, language was treated as decoration. Now, language is treated as infrastructure — it shapes the model’s behavior, reasoning, and how humans experience intelligence itself.
