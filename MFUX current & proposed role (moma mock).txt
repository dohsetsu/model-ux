As an L5 IC, Model-Facing User Experience (MFUX) Content Designer, you own outcomes for enhancing AI model outputs within one mature project, complex program, or emerging area.
You drive positive change by defining a scalable, user-centered approach to ensure AI-generated content is natural, engaging, and aligned with Gemini’s voice or feature-related persona. You influence by guiding the integration of AI within the UX ecosystem. You apply your expertise in UX principles, language nuances, and AI capabilities to craft compelling user experiences.
You collaborate with others to deliver work such as:
* Curating and preparing high-quality training data that optimizes AI model performance
* Defining output (especially across surfaces and modalities) guidelines and error handling strategies to ensure successful user interactions with a minimum of punts, divergence, or blocked prompts
* Conducting rigorous testing and evaluation of AI-generated content across various scenarios
* Developing and advocating for long-term AI integration strategies that enhance user-centered product experiences across modalities and surfaces
Scope and Impact
* Contribution:
   * Accountable for UX outcomes related to AI model outputs, ensuring positive and significant impact for users within the portfolio.
   * Increase product impact and improve user-centered outcomes by identifying opportunities and constraints within model (or models’) execution, and proposing and shaping user-centric UX solutions
   * Execute UX deliverables with the highest quality, serving as a subject-matter expert for both language and user-Gemini interactions.
   * Develop and advocate for long-term, user-centered AI strategies that drive impact across multiple teams and high-profile initiatives.
   * Scale work by defining, evolving, and upholding frameworks, systems, and standards that improve the quality and consistency of AI-generated content.


* Challenge:
   * Solve defined user problems related to AI interactions within one workstream, project, program, or process.
   * Navigate challenges across teams, such as aligning AI capabilities with user expectations and addressing potential biases in model outputs.
   * Anticipate and mitigate future issues through design strategies, such as defining patterns and frameworks for AI-generated content.
   * Recognize when a complex AI solution does not tangibly benefit users and recommend an alternative approach.


* Influence:
   * Influence stakeholders to align on high-priority goals and requirements for AI integration within UX.
   * Build partnerships with cross-functional stakeholders and leads to align on strategy and take initiative and/or provide collaborative input on user-centered AI-powered product experiences.
   * Guide UXers in identifying opportunities, complementary usages, and evolving the use of AI across the Gemini portfolio of products, capabilities, and experiences
   * Educate colleagues on the capabilities and limitations of AI models, fostering realistic expectations.


* Expertise:
   * Apply advanced knowledge of UX principles, AI capabilities, natural language processing, and user-centered product development.
   * Apply comprehensive knowledge of user needs, business goals, and the ethical considerations surrounding AI.
   * Stay abreast of AI advancements in the field and share knowledge with the team.
Key Points for Growth, Development, and Success in this role: 
Model Training and Optimization:
Expertise in curating training data, refining prompts, evaluation rubrics/ratings, and analyzing model outputs to ensure high-quality content.
User Experience Design for AI:
Showcase ability to help ensure and craft natural and intuitive AI interactions, anticipate user needs, manage edge cases, and understand trust and safety policies that affect or modify model output
Testing and Quality Assurance:
Demonstrate proficiency in evaluating AI-generated content, identifying biases, and ensuring brand alignment.
Collaboration and Communication:
Position yourself and your work as a bridge between product, design, research, and engineering teams, fostering understanding and advocating for user-centered AI experiences.

Overview
Subject-Matter Expert
As an L5 IC, User Experience (UX) Writer and Content Designer, you own outcomes for one mature project, complex program, or emerging area.
You drive positive change by defining a scalable, user-centered approach to solve difficult problems. You influence by guiding the momentum of related efforts. You apply your expertise by serving as a subject-matter expert in your craft, UX principles, user-centered product development methodologies, and research tools. You collaborate with others to deliver work such as: audits that analyze and identify opportunities to create UX solutions that increase product value; machine learning heuristics to scale product quality; writing and information design patterns across user experiences; product narratives that successfully guide the user through and within the product. You lead alignment efforts across teams or products to create cohesion. When proposing solutions, you may start with language, but look beyond words to influence design holistically. You have a proven ability to design products and deliver cohesive UX solutions for key parts of the product, platform, or user experience; and possess the depth of knowledge, experience, and business acumen required to assess and communicate rationale for your choices in terms of quality, longevity, and scalability; you collaborate and communicate effectively with cross-functional peers across Google. You also engage in community contributions to improve and sustain our culture and operations - making Google a better place to work.
